# Building Website Procedure

Website should lively and fun. It will be boring to follow the steps of paper/text projects. So we should enjoy ourselves when we building a website. Here is my way:

Outline
make a simple outline on any writing device
building menu according it
use this page as a template and build main pages by copying the menu
make the links and menu work so that you can easily navigate between them
write the basic ideas into each page. Now you have the outline of your web.
Research
set or refine goals for the website
Define websiteâ€™s target audience to see any needs for design in structure, content and aesthetic consideration.
search for similar website to compare and inspire
Preparing and writing content
Get images and video clips and sound tracks (It depends. This can be done long time ago or in the last minute or now or even later.)
Write titles and interesting words 
avoid long text if possible
Plan and design

Optionally, create a wireframe or mock-up
Assess and select technology list, such as languages, frameworks. (Keep learning new stuffs. The world is changing fast!)
